        <h3>Opera House</h3>
        <div class="activityText">
          Starting off with the most iconic landmark in Sydney, the opera house!
          There are multiple ways to experience the Sydney Opera House. Not all
          experiences need to cost money, the reason the building is so famous
          is because of its unique architecture and location. The best way to
          admire the building is to walk around the area and simply view the
          architecture. If you want to go inside the building, there are tours
          available for about 50$ for an adult, and if you want to see a show it
          will cost you anywhere from 70$ to several hundred dollars depending
          on both the show and the seating.

        <h3>Bondi Beach Surfing</h3>
        <div class="activityText">
          Visit the world-famous Bondi Beach, which is accessible by a short bus
          trip from Sydney's city center costing 1-4$. Surfing lessons are
          available for all ages and skill levels. Although most water based
          activities are exhausting, there are many great places to dine close
          to the beach. Speaking from experience, Chuck Trailer's was a great
          place to grab a bite, in true Aussie fashion the people were some of
          the most pleasant.

        <h3>Whale Safari</h3>
        <div class="activityText">
          Go on a whale safari from Sydney to see the majestic humpback whales
          that migrate along the coast. The best time to see whales is from May
          to November, when they are migrating north to breed and give birth in
          the warmer waters of Queensland. Some tours even offer the chance to
          swim with dolphins or snorkel in the ocean. Overall, a whale safari
          from Sydney is a unique and unforgettable experience that allows you
          to witness these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat.
          Several companies offer whale watching tours from Sydney, with prices
          ranging from around $50 to $150 per person depending on the duration
          and type of tour.

          The Royal Botanic Garden is a large, beautiful garden located in

          animals. It is a great place to go for a walk, relax, and see some of
          the beautiful flora and fauna that Australia has to offer. This
          experience could be great after any hectic day, as tiring as vacation
          on the other side of the world is. To walk through the garden is
          completely free, although events and guided tours may have a fee.
